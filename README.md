In this project we will see an implementation of the dancing links algorithm for solving sudoku boards of sizes 1x1 to 25x25 in a very short time.

Sudoku instructions:
Sudoku is a game where you get a board and our goal is to complete it
Each board comes with a variable amount of clues (numbers already placed on the board as data).
Sudoku will be correct if every number does not repeat itself in the same row, column or box.
Each cell must contain a number
